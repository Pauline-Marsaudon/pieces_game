# Brain 3D Learning & Stimulation

An interactive tool developed with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for learning and exploring different areas of the human brain in 3D. This project allows users not only to visualize brain regions but also to stimulate each area in their own brain (not complete for now).

## Link to test the application in live
Here is the limk : https://francois-lqc.github.io/brain_vrar/

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Exploration:** Navigate and explore a detailed 3D brain model.

- **Brain Area Information:** Click on an area to display descriptive information about it.

- **Area Stimulation:** The area chosen can be stimulated in your brain with a little game.


## Installation
### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Francois-lqc/brain_vrar.git
```

### Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd brain_vrar
```

### Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed before running this command
```bash
npm install
```

### Run the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage
- **Exploration:** Use the mouse to rotate and zoom in on the 3D brain model.

- **Area Selection:** Click on a brain region to view description.

- **Stimulation:** Click on a button to trigger a game stimulating this area in your brain.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js:** With WebXR and Vite, used for the 3D / AR part.

- **JavaScript:** The main language for implementing logic.

- **HTML/CSS:** For the base of the application
